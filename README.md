# HTTP Resolver Python Library

## Overview

This Python library provides a higher-level abstraction for resolving HTTPS URLs. It leverages the `requests` library to simplify the process of making HTTP GET requests and handling responses. The library is suitable for cases where a straightforward resolution of a URL over HTTPS is needed.

For a lower-level implementation, you can check the [http-resolver-py](https://github.com/aastik7/http-resolver-py) repository.

## Installation

To use this library, you need to have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install requests
